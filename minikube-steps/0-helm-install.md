To install Helm on Minikube, you need to follow a few simple steps. Below are the instructions to set up Helm in your Minikube environment.

### Step 1: Install Helm

If you haven't installed Helm yet, you can do so by following these steps based on your operating system.

#### For macOS
If you have Homebrew installed, you can simply run:
```bash
brew install helm
```

#### For Windows
You can use Chocolatey to install Helm:
```bash
choco install kubernetes-helm
```
Alternatively, you can download the binary from the [Helm releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) and add it to your system's PATH.

#### For Linux
You can use the following commands to install Helm:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```
This script automatically downloads and installs the latest version of Helm.

### Step 2: Verify Installation
After installing, verify that Helm is installed correctly by checking its version:
```bash
helm version
```

### Step 3: Initialize Helm (If Needed)
In Helm v3 and above, thereâ€™s no need for a Tiller installation as in Helm v2. You can directly start using Helm with your Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 4: Configure Helm to Use Minikube
Make sure your Helm is configured to use your Minikube cluster. If you have just started Minikube, it should be set up by default. You can confirm this by running:
```bash
kubectl config current-context
```
